# Python-Programming

A brief description of this repository containing all test project files, including the revision history of my own Python knowledge. The purpose of this project is own practice. The main focus is practicing python with a project by sort of real-life examples, and learning or exercising Python in a better way.


## Project Title

Mainly, the Project title is **"Scientific programming with Python"**.

## Project Goals

To know the core concepts of Python from both a data science and industrial programming perspective. We will learn concepts of Python, machine learning, and computer networks through hands-on programming exercises using scientific datasets from synchrotrons and FEL radiation. To acquire the competence to analyze complex data and large data sets from experiments in the field of X-ray and nanotechnology research. To know the concepts of FAIR data and data management and know how this is dealt with in the DAPHNE4NFDI project.


### Content

- Introduction to Python: variables, data types, loops, arrays, functions, Classes and Objects, Inheritance, File Manipulation, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.

- Machine learning: Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, scikit-learn, tensorflow, SciPy, development and training of neural networks.

- Networks and hardware: network services in Python, TPC/IP protocol, socket programming.

- FAIR data: collection of metadata, electronic logbooks, data repositories, data management plans.


## Demo

Source Code:

```python
# This program prints Hello, world!

print('Hello, world!')
```

Output:

> Hello, world!
